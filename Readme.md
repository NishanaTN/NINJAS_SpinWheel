Project Description

The Wonder Spin Wheel is a playful, imagination-powered device designed to surprise and amuse its users. With a single spin, it lands on one of four whimsical tools — none of which are actually useful, but all of which are guaranteed to make you smile.

People everywhere suffer from boring edible recipes that fail to spark confusion, laughter, or artistic outrage.We built a recipe generator that replaces dull, edible meals with nonsensical, whimsical, and impractical creations—made from items like bubble wrap, moonlight, lost socks, and sawdust. No sustenance, just nonsense.

The  Clock is an imaginary timepiece with 13 hours in a day, 100 minutes per hour, and 100 seconds per minute. It doesn’t follow real-world time but creates its own unique rhythm, making it perfect for fantasy worlds and creative storytelling.

A calendar system with 9 months in a year, each having 40 days. Every month is divided into 8 weeks, with 5 days per week. The calendar allows users to view months, weeks, and mark events according to this unique time structure. It demonstrates how calendar designs can be adapted for worlds with different time systems.

A calculator that never tells the truth. Every answer is deliberately wrong—sometimes a little off, sometimes wildly inaccurate. Designed for fun, pranks, and as a reminder that not all tools can be trusted!

This project is not meant to be practical but rather a humorous and creative showcase of absurd functionality. It’s perfect for novelty events, ice-breaker activities, or as a conversation starter at parties. The joy is in the randomness, silliness, and creativity it inspires.
